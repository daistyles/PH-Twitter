# PH Twitter

Hello Product Hunt!

Most of my time over at Twitter is spent finding new products share by Product Hunt or by other makers/hunters such as
Chris Messina, Kevin, Jake, Ryan or Nik vimal but what I always missed was to have some stats that I could get beforehand whenever a new product is shared/posted which lets me know more about the product and how much traction it is getting. With this tool which I have been using for a while now made me want to know more about the product by going to it's PH page than ever before. Whenever a new product is posted the extension will automatically find the details and add a small non-intrusive box on the side of the tweet letting you know more about the product.

Here's what the box contains:
💯 or ⬆️ tells you the total votes the particular product got at the time you're seeing it.
✍ shows the total comments.
and, ✔️ or ❌ shows whether the Product has been featured or not.

I hope you all like this tool. Thanks! 😺
